<h1>More Information about Climate Change and Global Warming</h1> 

<li>Although Global Warming and Climate Change are used interchangably, they are slightly different.  Global Warming refers to the long-term warming of the planet whereas Climate Change refers to the borader range of changes that happen to our planet such as rising sea levels, ice melt, etc.</li>

<br/>
<br/>

<li>Causes of both Climate Change and Global Warming: Greenhouse gasses such as methane and CO2, absorptionn of the sun's energy, natural processes such as change in earth's orbit, variation in solar activity, volcanic activity and natural production of CO2, deforestation, littering/non-renewable waste.</li>

<br/>
<br/>

<li>Effects of Climate Change and Global Warming: Constant rise in temperature, increased length of growing season(Frost-free season), change in precipitation patterns, more droughts, stronger hurricanes, constant rise in sea level, constant rate of ice melt.</li>
